Polynomial definition for calculator, for example:
"- 3x + 2x^2 + 3 - 9"
or:
"2.0 + 3.0x + 10.3x^2"
As you can see, there must always be a space between polynomial elements and signs, the variable must be 'x',
the coefficients can be real numbers, but the powers of 'x' must be natural numbers (> 0).
Otherwise, the application will not allow you to count anything.
